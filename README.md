  <h1>PhriX (A Lightweight PHP Micro Framework)</h1>
  <span>PhriX is a simple, no-bloat PHP micro-framework built for small-to-medium web applications. It offers essential tools like routing, middleware, templating, and basic request/response handling -- nothing more, nothing less.</span>
</div>

### üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Clean, chainable routing (`$route->get('/', 'welcome');`)
- Middleware support (`$route->get(...)->middleware('auth');`)
- Simple templating (`@include`, `@asset`, `@title`)
- Request & Response abstraction
- JSON, View, Text, and Redirect response types
- Slug/URL parameter support (`/post/{slug}`)
- Lightweight logging system
- Project boot file (`public/index.php`) < 20 lines
- No unnecessary magic
 
### üõ£Ô∏è Why PhriX?
Most PHP frameworks try to be everything. Phrix focuses on only what's essential for early-stage projects:
- Simplicity over features
- Flat structure (everything is where you expect it)
- Readable source (you can skim the whole core in minutes)
- Designed for maintainability and quick iteration

### ‚úÖ Getting Started
Clone the repository and start:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ujarhr/phrix-php`
2. `cd phrix`
